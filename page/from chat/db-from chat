In this blockchain-based pet adoption project, a traditional database isn't strictly necessary because the blockchain itself can serve as the primary data storage for adoption-related information. Here's a breakdown of when you might use a database and when you can rely solely on the blockchain:

When You Don't Need a Database
Ownership Tracking: The smart contract already stores who has adopted each pet. For example, the adopters array in the Adoption smart contract keeps track of pet ownership using the Ethereum address of the adopter.
Immutable Records: If you only need a list of adopted pets and want to ensure the data is immutable and secure, the blockchain is sufficient.
Decentralization: If you want to avoid centralized storage and rely entirely on decentralized technology, using only the blockchain makes sense.
When You Might Need a Database
Storing Additional Data: If you need to store extra information not covered by the blockchain (like pet images, detailed descriptions, or user profiles), using a database would help. Blockchains are not ideal for storing large amounts of non-essential data because of cost and scalability.
Search and Filter: Databases are efficient for searching, filtering, and sorting data. If you need to show lists of pets by age, breed, or health status, a database would provide faster queries than a blockchain.
Data Synchronization: If you have complex data management that requires real-time updates, synchronization, or analytics, you might need a database alongside the blockchain.
User Management: For user accounts, authentication, or authorization, you might use a database to store additional user details not tied to the blockchain.
Recommendation for This Project
You can start with a purely blockchain-based solution and add a traditional database if you need more features or face limitations. Here's how you can structure both scenarios:

1. Blockchain-Only Solution
Store pet ownership and adoption status on the blockchain.
Use the smart contract to handle all adoption-related logic.
Store pet details (e.g., name, age, breed) directly in the smart contract, if the data size is small and fixed.
No traditional database is required.


Blockchain (Smart Contract) Tasks:

Track pet ownership.
Store immutable records of adoption transactions.
